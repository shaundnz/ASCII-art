# ASCII-art
Java program that reads an image and prints it using ASCII characters to the console.
Program reads RGB values of pixels and calculates brightness to choose a corresponding character. Motivated by my interest in Javaâ€™s image processing libraries and learning how to implement multithreading with SwingWorker.
